# go-homeserver
The aim of this project is to create a nice WebUI which allows you to access the files on your Homeserver/NAS/Respberyy PI/... . Additionally the WebUI should provide basic functions to manage your files like move, delete, archive, ...
It is also planned to create a way to trigger actions on remote devices like start playing a media file on your Raspberry PI.
It is also planned to implement basic sorting functionality. This should take files from an input directory and sort them into your library/archive based on filetypes or other rules.
